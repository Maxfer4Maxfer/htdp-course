; PROBLEM:
; 
; DESIGN a function called area that consumes the length of one side 
; of a square and produces the area of the square.
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

; Number -> Number
; given length of one side of square, produce the area of the square

(check-expect (area 3) 3)
(check-expect (area 3.2) (* 3.2 3.2))

(define (area s) 
  (* s s))
